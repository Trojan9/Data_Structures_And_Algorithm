class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words, k):
        # Step 1: Count frequency
        count = Counter(words)

        # Step 2: Build heap (negative frequency so most frequent comes first)
        heap = [(-freq, word) for word, freq in count.items()]
        heapq.heapify(heap)

        # Step 3: Get top k words
        result = [heapq.heappop(heap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
        return result


ðŸ§  What's a Heap?
A heap is just a special kind of tree data structure used for quick access to the smallest or largest item.

In Python, we usually work with min-heaps using the heapq module.

ðŸ”½ Min-Heap:
The smallest value comes first.

In Python, heapq uses a list under the hood.

ðŸ‘‡ Why Use a Heap in This Problem?
You want:

The k most frequent words.

If two words have the same frequency, the one with lower alphabetical order comes first.

To do this with a heap:

You push (-frequency, word) â€” we use negative frequency to turn Pythonâ€™s min-heap into a max-heap.

This way, the most frequent words come out first!
