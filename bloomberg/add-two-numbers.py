###just studies about linked list

Absolutely! Let’s break down **Linked Lists** from the ground up, in a way that’s easy to understand.

---

## 🧠 What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a data structure where each element (called a **node**) contains:
1. A **value**
2. A **pointer/reference** to the **next node**

---

### 🔗 Example of a Singly Linked List:

```
[1] → [2] → [3] → [4] → None
```

- Each `[x]` is a node
- Each arrow `→` is the link (pointer)
- The last node points to `None` (end of list)

---

## 🔄 Types of Linked Lists

1. **Singly Linked List**
   - Points only to the **next** node
2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Each node points to both **next** and **previous**
3. **Circular Linked List**
   - Last node points back to the **first node**

---

## ✅ Why Use Linked Lists?

| Array | Linked List |
|-------|-------------|
| Fast index access (`O(1)`) | Slow access (`O(n)`) |
| Expensive insert/delete in middle (`O(n)`) | Fast insert/delete at any point (`O(1)` if pointer known) |
| Fixed size (unless resized) | Dynamic size |

Linked lists are great when:
- You need **fast inserts/deletes**
- You **don’t need random access** (i.e., `arr[10]`)

---

## 🛠️ Basic Operations You Should Know

### 1. Create a Node

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
```

---

### 2. Create a Linked List (manually)

```python
node1 = Node(1)
node2 = Node(2)
node1.next = node2
```

---

### 3. Traverse a Linked List

```python
current = node1
while current:
    print(current.val)
    current = current.next
```

---

### 4. Insert at the Beginning

```python
new_node = Node(0)
new_node.next = node1
head = new_node
```

---

### 5. Insert at the End

```python
current = head
while current.next:
    current = current.next
current.next = Node(99)
```

---

### 6. Delete a Node (by value)

```python
def delete_node(head, target):
    if head.val == target:
        return head.next

    current = head
    while current.next:
        if current.next.val == target:
            current.next = current.next.next
            return head
        current = current.next
    return head
```

---

## 📌 Common Interview Questions Involving Linked Lists

- Reverse a linked list
- Detect a cycle
- Merge two sorted linked lists
- Find middle of a linked list
- Remove nth node from the end
- Add two numbers (like LeetCode’s [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/))

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

- **Linked List = nodes linked by pointers**
- Efficient at **inserting/removing**, but slow for **index-based access**
- Important for interview questions, especially for pointer/recursion practice
