for bfs we use mostly deque

at 7:00 of 18:29....you would see how dequeue works


we pop the first element in that order to explore i.e popleft

                a
            b       c
        d       e       f

        a|b|c|d|e|f


#start with a...we add a to the queue...then we check while queue is not empty the loop will run

2.we explore a , then we can find b and c attached...we will add them to the queue

3.next up is to explore b..we can find d and e attached to it..we will add them to the queue also

4. next is to explore c which is next on the queue..we can see  f attached to it also...we will add it to the queue also

5.next is to explore d (don't forget to pop)..we have nothing attached to this..move to next

6.pop the next and explore..which is e..we have nothing attached to it..we move to next

7.pop the next which is f...f has nothing attached to it also

8.the loop stops cuz queue is empty


DFS


a|b|d|e|c|f

1.we start at a...we go left...we explore b...b also has a left...we explore d which is the next left.

2. d has no left and right to it...we go back to b to check for the right

3.b has a right to it whcich is e...we the check for left ,but e has no left...we also check for right...which it doesn't have

4.we go back to b...the back to a , a has a right , we will explore c which is the right of a...

5. c is on a right so we check the
