so initially they would give us value of n..so our arry will be a value from 1-n
our pointer will start at l=0..or first index..l=0 sha.
#..so basically when we insert value at our pointer,we will move it to the next empty index..notice that our pointer doesn't move until we fill the pointer position with something ..so we could have inserted something in some indexes after the present pointer..
#so basically when we insert and our pointer moves..we return value from the former pointer(include) to the new pointer(not inclusive)

    [ a   b   c   d   e]
      1   2   3   4   5
                            p
                            
so basically just initialize an array of value None * n

You need to:

Create a stream (like a list) that can hold n items.

Receive items using a function insert(id, value).

Return a list of values starting from the current position, only if they are available in the correct order.

ðŸ“¦ Example
If you create a stream of size 5:

stream = OrderedStream(5)
And then call:

stream.insert(3, "ccccc") â†’ []
stream.insert(1, "aaaaa") â†’ ["aaaaa"]
stream.insert(2, "bbbbb") â†’ ["bbbbb", "ccccc"]
Hereâ€™s why:

The pointer starts at position 1

You inserted item 3 â†’ can't use it yet (waiting for 1)

Then you inserted 1 â†’ now we can return 1

Then 2 â†’ now we can return 2 and also 3 since both are filled

âœ… Step-by-Step Plan
Weâ€™ll:

-Use a list to hold the values (like [None, None, ..., None])

-Use a pointer to track the current usable position

-Each time insert(id, value) is called:

-Put the value in the list at id - 1

-If the pointer is ready, collect values until there's a gap

##explanation so basicly, pointer won't move until there is a value at current pointer position
stream = OrderedStream(5)---5 indexs
And then call:
---pointer is at index 0
stream.insert(3, "ccccc") â†’ [] ---insert in position 3, which is index 2, but nothing is at index 0, so pointer doesn't move..we return []
stream.insert(1, "aaaaa") â†’ ["aaaaa"]--insert index 0 (position 1), now index 0 has value, pointer moves to 1, but index 1 is empty, we return only value at index 0
stream.insert(2, "bbbbb") â†’ ["bbbbb", "ccccc"]-insert index 1(position 2), now remember pointer is at index 1, index 1 has value, store the value for return; we move pointer to index 2, index 2(position3) also have value ,we store the vaalue for return, we move index pointer to index 3,which is empty, so we return only value at index 1 and 2.

    def insert(self, id: int, value: str) -> List[str]:

        self.stream[id - 1] = value
        result = []

        # If the pointer is at a filled position, start collecting values
        while self.ptr < len(self.stream) and self.stream[self.ptr] is not None:
            result.append(self.stream[self.ptr])
            self.ptr += 1  # move pointer forward

        return result

# Your OrderedStream object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = OrderedStream(n)
# param_1 = obj.insert(idKey,value)
