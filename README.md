 - CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to get eventual consistency without coordination overhead.
 - Lockless data structures to get high concurrency through atomic operations and memory ordering.
 - Partitioning to get improved performance by dividing data based on access patterns.
 - Materialized views to get fast complex queries by pre-computing and storing results.
 - Delta compression to get reduced storage by storing only differences between versions.
